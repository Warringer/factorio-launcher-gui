# factorio-launcher-gui
Just a little launcher Python3 tkinter gui for launching Factorio with different mod sets.

At the moment it only supports Linux with steam and the launcher files need to be updated for the systems they are used in...

This is for Linux only at the moment and makes use of the ~/.factorio directory.

Please put your mods packs into any directory in ~/.factorio/<modpack>.
  
The format of factorio-mods.json is:

{
	"Vanilla": "",
	"Vanilla Plus": "vanillaplus",
	"AngelsBobs": "angelsbobs",
  <Mod Pack> : <directory>
}
