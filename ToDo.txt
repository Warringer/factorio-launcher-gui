Just a little ToDo list of potential features in no particular order:

- Add functionality to have different blueprint files per mod
    Save the blueprint file in the mod directly and overwrite before each launch?
- Add functionality to add Mod Pack directories from doanloaded zip files containing multiple mods
    e.g. Nilaus mod packs for each of his series
    Creates a new mod directory and unzips the files
    Perhaps with progress bar based in the number of files in the zip and displaying every unzipped file
